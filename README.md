# My Personal Website

This project is a personal website, built using HTML/CSS and JavaScript, which I use to display all of my projects in a concise, clean format. I also include some further details about myself, such as my work experience and contact details.

The website contains three pages:
<ul>
  <li>Experience: A timeline of my current work experience, and some details about each role.</li>
  <li>Projects: Clickable panels of my personal projects, along with some University work, providing detailed explanations and images of each project, as well as links to GitHub repositories.</li>
  <li>Contact: A contact page, containing my Email, LinkedIn and Github</li>
</ul>

This website is being regularly updated, changing as I start and complete new roles and projects!
